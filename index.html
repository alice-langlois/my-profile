	  I have always been curious and hardworking, that's how I acquired some work experiences that allowed me to realize the field in which I want to work later.

	  Also, in this area, I had the opportunity to do an <span id="bold"> internship as an assistant stylist for a shoot in Brazil.</span id="bold"> 
	  I have also done student jobs such as <span id="bold"> waitress in a bar / restaurant, multi-skilled team member in Leclerc drive</span id="bold">  and <span id="bold"> many babysittings.</span id="bold">
